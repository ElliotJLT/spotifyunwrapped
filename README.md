## What

Spotify Wrapped gives you a 60-second slideshow once a year. This gives you the full picture — any time, with your complete listening history. Upload your Spotify data export and get deep analytics: forgotten favourites, obsession phases, late-night music taste, session patterns, and more. All processing happens client-side. Your data never leaves your device.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElliotJLT/spotifyunwrapped.git
cd spotifyunwrapped
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then request your data from [Spotify Privacy Settings](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) (select "Extended streaming history"). Upload the JSON files when they arrive.
